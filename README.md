# Pong Game

This is a basic 2D Pong game where two players (or one player and an AI opponent) compete to score points by hitting a ball back and forth. Here's a breakdown of the key elements and gameplay:

**Game Setup**

<li><b>Board:</b> The game is played on a 500x500 pixel canvas.</li><br>
<b>Players:</b>
<li><b>Player 1:</b> Controlled by the user, with up/down movement keys ("W" for up and "S" for down).</li>
<li><b>Player 2:</b> Controlled by AI, which moves automatically based on the ball's position.</li><br><br>

**Game Mechanics**<br>
**Movement:**<br>

<li><b>Player 1:</b> Moves up or down using the "W" and "S" keys.</li>
<li><b>Player 2 (AI):</b> The AI attempts to follow the ballâ€™s Y-position and adjusts its movement accordingly.</li><br><br>
